    <h1>Michael Elumeev</h1>
    <p><em>Field Support Engineer at Cognyte with more than 15 years of sector
      in the Telecommunication sphere</em></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I am an open-minded ready-to-challenges person who understands the necessity of constant self-development. I regard the latter one as an occupational hazard if you are not
  growing as a specialist, in my reality, it means soon professional succumbing and disappearance.
I love all things tech and I am not ashamed to concede that I don't know something, I am ashamed to repeat this confession about the very same matter. I love people I work with and I respect them even if they disagree with my point of view. The cornerstone of progressing and growth in my specialty is an ability to come
to a consensus and be ready to go to compromises. It is not a trade-off, it is a sign of professionalism.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies: </h3>
    <ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Workouts and everything related to the gym. I cannot say that I am a pro, I am at a far-cry from being called so, yet I love pumping iron. It rejuvenates me and gives me some moments to reinvent myself.</li>
      <li>Everything related to new technologies. Again, I am not a geek, but I am so enthusiatic about everything going on and I am so afraid of missing something as groundbreaking as AI or NeuroLink, so I do my best to stay tuned in.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if reading can be considering as a hobby, but I love books and I love the process of reading especially when we do it together with my kids.</li>
      <li>I guess I can dub myself as a perpetuate English student and I don't see anything embarassing about it. My regards to Coach Shane for coaching me.</li>
